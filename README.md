# Find Grant IDs by Funder â€“ OpenAlex Explorer

https://fgif-tool.streamlit.app/

This tool helps you explore research grants associated with specific funders using **OpenAlex**. 
Simply search for a funder, select one from the list, and retrieve all grant IDs linked to that funder. 
You can then download the results as a CSV for further analysis.

## Use cases  
- Identify which grants a funder has supported.  
- Enrich local research data with grant information.  
- Cross-reference grants with publications for funding analysis.

âš  **Limitations:**  
- Some grants may be missing or incorrectly linked due to metadata inconsistencies.  
- Large funders may have thousands of grants, so fetching data can take time.
